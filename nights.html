<div class="BeAtOne">
  <p><strong>Be At One</strong><span class="price">££</span><br />

</div>
<div class="Alchemist">
  <p><strong>The Alchemist</strong><span class="price">£££</span><br />
  <small>The Alchemist is a very pricy cocktail bar but also very popular as it is a unique experience. The Alchemist describes itself as "masters in the dark arts of molecular mixology and demons in the kitchen... mixologists create every cocktail with an obsessive eye for detail, presented in vessels orchestrated to add a devilish dash of theatre, they bedazzle, bewitch and set the scene for everything we do". Located Yorkshire House, Greek St, Leeds LS1 5SH.</small></p>
</div>

<div class="LasIguanas">
  <p><strong>Las Iguanas</strong><span class="price">££</span><br />
  <small>This place is a personal favouite venue to go to, not for the food, despite it being a chain resturant, but for the cocktail bar, always with two for one on their delicious cocktails. The location is also great before a night out on Call Lane which is just round the corner. Location Unit 3 Cloth Hall St, Leeds LS1 2HD.</small></p>
</div>

<div class="Hedley">
  <p><strong>The Hedley Verity</strong><span class="price">£</span><br />
    <small> The Headley Verity is a classic Spoons pub. Cheap food and drinks, therefore a fantastic night out in Leeds. There are multiple Wetherspoons in the center of Leeds. There is one in the train station (North Concourse, Leeds City Station, Leeds LS1 4DY), Becketts Bank (28-30 Park Row, Leeds LS1 5HU), The Cuthbert Brodrick (99 Portland Cres, Leeds LS1 3HJ) and The Headley Verity (43a, Woodhouse Ln, Leeds LS1 3HQ) however the way in which Headley Verity differs from the others is because after a certain time, aprox 9:30pm, the classic pub dims the lights and becomes a night club with loud music and a dancefloor. </small></p>
